    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The word polymorphism means having many
        forms. In simple words, we can define
        polymorphism as the ability of a message
        to be displayed in more than one form.
        A real-life example of polymorphism, a
        person at the same time can have
        different characteristics.
        Like a man at the same time is a father,
        a husband, an employee. So the same
        person posses different behavior in
        different situations. This is called
        polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
        as one of the important features of Object
        Oriented Programming.
