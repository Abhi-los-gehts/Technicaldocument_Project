            Why you need Technical Document?
        </div>

        <div class="main">
            <p>A designer might have to work on a project for an extended period of time. When the time for delivery comes, they might have to look back at their process and document it. Which makes it a bit difficult as you have to recall the things which you have done a few months before. To avoid such a scenario let’s understand why UX documentation is so important.</p>

                <li>To keep multiple designers working on the same project collaborate — teammates can see each other’s updates if they are continuously adding their task data and analysis in a shared document. Using platforms like FIGJAM, Microsoft Word or Google docs is the best example of such practices.</li>
                <li>UX documentation with few edits can be used as a case study — you might have often come across companies that present their past projects as a form of a case study which is nothing but a small portion of their design documentation that showcases how they solved the challenge with their UX process.</li>

                <li>It can be considered as an additional deliverable —not all clients request full UX process as deliverables. But when working for a freelance client where you are also building up a trust relationship for future projects, I have observed that UX documentation always acts as a cherry on top of other deliverables. It also adds a professional touch to your task.</li>

                <li>UX documentation with few edits can be used as a case study — you might have often come across companies that present their past projects as a form of a case study which is nothing but a small portion of their design documentation that showcases how they solved the challenge with their UX process.</li>

                <li>It helps new onboarding designers — people who join the project midway need lots of KT and exploration not just about the product but also about our approach as designers to solve them. I have observed that when a team of designers is documenting the UX process side by side, then the documented data can be referred to catch up to the ongoing process in a much faster way</li>

                <li>It also gives a roadmap for future updates — in the future if the project is evolving the revampers often look for legacy research approaches and UI data.</li>

                <br>Technical documentation is vitally important for your software company. Here are some reasons <br><b> Enables quick decision-making by the product team</b><br>
                When your product team has access to the right technical documentation, they can make much quicker decisions. They don’t have to scroll back through emails or threads in collaboration tools – they can instead instantly consult the documents produced alongside the software that explains how everything works and records the reasoning behind the decisions.
                <br>
                <br><b>Help for users</b> <br>
                When customers are using their software they can access your technical documentation alongside the product for help in using the tool. Documentation can be displayed in-app so customers don’t have to switch contexts when they run into issues. This improves the overall usability and experience of your software product.
